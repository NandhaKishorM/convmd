# convmed
worlds first social media platform for sharing analyzed health records, chest x-rays and medical reports
# Inspiration
Social medias like instagram, facebook and whatsapp has become our day to day life and we are even so attached to the user experience of these social media applications. We thought what if we can develop a social media application for hospitals which can be used exclusively to analyse-share-save health records, chest X-Rays and medical records
# What id does
**ConvMed** is a social media mobile application built on **kotlin** for hospitals to analyze Electronic Health Records, medical tests, Chest X-Rays, etc powered by AWS Comprehend, AWS Lambda and AWS EC2. The analysed results are stored as comments in the post and  can be accessed by doctors, lab assistants any other healthcare workers within the hospitals protecting the privacy.
